<h1>Why Lewis Hamilton is the goat...</h1>
<p>Lets look at the stats quickly... Lewis Hamilton has 7 world championships (should be 8) and people still think Max Verstappen is better! How? Max has 2 world championships when lewis has 7! I think that Lewis will be getting his 8th this year personally. Anyways lets check out Lewis Hamiltons story..
 </p>
<p> Lewis grew up in a poor enviroment but his perents put all of their money into karting for Lewis. He raced a lot and became a very skilled driver. He was very fast aroubd the track and had amazing potential. He grew up karting even more and he became even better. Before you new it he started racing for mclaren in 2007 for his first year he did amazingly and finished 3rd in the championship! In 2008 only in his second year he one the championship and became the youngest person in history to win a world championship! In 2009 he had a worse year but he still did alright. In 2010 lewis was challenging for the title again! sadly he lost it in the last race.2011 to 2012 was his last year with mclaren he finished well but didnt win the championship. Up until 2022 he has been with mercades. getting them 6 championships and dominating up until 2021 and 2022 seasons. Lewis has had an amazing career and he aims to show all black people around the world to follow their dreams as he was bullied racialy in his karting days.</p>
